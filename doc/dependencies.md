### <a href="http://wiki.github.com/wvanbergen/chunky_png">chunky_png</a> v1.3.1
#### Pure ruby library for read/write, chunk-level access to PNG files

<a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license">MIT</a> whitelisted

    This pure Ruby library can read and write PNG images without depending on an external 
    image library, like RMagick. It tries to be memory efficient and reasonably fast.
    
    It supports reading and writing all PNG variants that are defined in the specification, 
    with one limitation: only 8-bit color depth is supported. It supports all transparency, 
    interlacing and filtering options the PNG specifications allows. It can also read and 
    write textual metadata from PNG files. Low-level read/write access to PNG chunks is
    also possible.
    
    This library supports simple drawing on the image canvas and simple operations like
    alpha composition and cropping. Finally, it can import from and export to RMagick for 
    interoperability.
    
    Also, have a look at OilyPNG at http://github.com/wvanbergen/oily_png. OilyPNG is a 
    drop in mixin module that implements some of the ChunkyPNG algorithms in C, which 
    provides a massive speed boost to encoding and decoding.

<a name="mime-types"></a>
### <a href="http://mime-types.rubyforge.org/">mime-types</a> v1.25.1
#### This library allows for the identification of a file's likely MIME content type

<a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license">MIT</a> whitelisted

This library allows for the identification of a file's likely MIME content
type. This is release 1.25.1, fixing an issue with priority comparison for
mime-types 1.x. The current release is 2.0, which only supports Ruby 1.9 or
later.

Release 1.25.1 contains all features of 1.25, including the experimental
caching and lazy loading functionality. The caching and lazy loading features
were initially implemented by Greg Brockman (gdb). As these features are
experimental, they are disabled by default and must be enabled through the use
of environment variables. The cache is invalidated on a per-version basis; the
cache for version 1.25 will not be reused for any later version.

To use lazy loading, set the environment variable +RUBY_MIME_TYPES_LAZY_LOAD+
to any value other than 'false'. When using lazy loading, the initial startup
of MIME::Types is around 12–25× faster than normal startup (on my system,
normal startup is about 90 ms; lazy startup is about 4 ms). This isn't
generally useful, however, as the MIME::Types database has not been loaded.
Lazy startup and load is just *slightly* faster—around 1 ms. The real advantage
comes from using the cache.

To enable the cache, set the environment variable +RUBY_MIME_TYPES_CACHE+ to a
filename where MIME::Types will have read-write access. The first time a new
version of MIME::Types is run using this file, it will be created, taking a
little longer than normal. Subsequent loads using the same cache file will be
approximately 3½× faster (25 ms) than normal loads. This can be combined with
+RUBY_MIME_TYPES_LAZY_LOAD+, but this is *not* recommended in a multithreaded
or multiprocess environment where all threads or processes will be using the
same cache file.

As the caching interface is still experimental, the only values cached are the
default MIME::Types database, not any custom MIME::Types added by users.

MIME types are used in MIME-compliant communications, as in e-mail or HTTP
traffic, to indicate the type of content which is transmitted. MIME::Types
provides the ability for detailed information about MIME entities (provided as
a set of MIME::Type objects) to be determined and used programmatically. There
are many types defined by RFCs and vendors, so the list is long but not
complete; don't hesitate to ask to add additional information. This library
follows the IANA collection of MIME types (see below for reference).

MIME::Types for Ruby was originally based on MIME::Types for Perl by Mark
Overmeer, copyright 2001 - 2009.

MIME::Types is built to conform to the MIME types of RFCs 2045 and 2231. It
tracks the {IANA registry}[http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/]
({ftp}[ftp://ftp.iana.org/assignments/media-types]) with some unofficial types
added from the {LTSW collection}[http://www.ltsw.se/knbase/internet/mime.htp]
and added by the users of MIME::Types.

<a name="minitest"></a>
### <a href="https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest">minitest</a> v5.4.2
#### minitest provides a complete suite of testing facilities supporting TDD, BDD, mocking, and benchmarking

<a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license">MIT</a> whitelisted

minitest provides a complete suite of testing facilities supporting
TDD, BDD, mocking, and benchmarking.

    "I had a class with Jim Weirich on testing last week and we were
     allowed to choose our testing frameworks. Kirk Haines and I were
     paired up and we cracked open the code for a few test
     frameworks...

     I MUST say that minitest is *very* readable / understandable
     compared to the 'other two' options we looked at. Nicely done and
     thank you for helping us keep our mental sanity."

    -- Wayne E. Seguin

minitest/unit is a small and incredibly fast unit testing framework.
It provides a rich set of assertions to make your tests clean and
readable.

minitest/spec is a functionally complete spec engine. It hooks onto
minitest/unit and seamlessly bridges test assertions over to spec
expectations.

minitest/benchmark is an awesome way to assert the performance of your
algorithms in a repeatable manner. Now you can assert that your newb
co-worker doesn't replace your linear algorithm with an exponential
one!

minitest/mock by Steven Baker, is a beautifully tiny mock (and stub)
object framework.

minitest/pride shows pride in testing and adds coloring to your test
output. I guess it is an example of how to write IO pipes too. :P

minitest/unit is meant to have a clean implementation for language
implementors that need a minimal set of methods to bootstrap a working
test suite. For example, there is no magic involved for test-case
discovery.

    "Again, I can't praise enough the idea of a testing/specing
     framework that I can actually read in full in one sitting!"

    -- Piotr Szotkowski

Comparing to rspec:

    rspec is a testing DSL. minitest is ruby.

    -- Adam Hawkins, "Bow Before MiniTest"

minitest doesn't reinvent anything that ruby already provides, like:
classes, modules, inheritance, methods. This means you only have to
learn ruby to use minitest and all of your regular OO practices like
extract-method refactorings still apply.

Rake is a Make-like program implemented in Ruby. Tasks and dependencies are
specified in standard Ruby syntax.

Rake has the following features:

* Rakefiles (rake's version of Makefiles) are completely defined in
  standard Ruby syntax.  No XML files to edit.  No quirky Makefile
  syntax to worry about (is that a tab or a space?)

* Users can specify tasks with prerequisites.

* Rake supports rule patterns to synthesize implicit tasks.

* Flexible FileLists that act like arrays but know about manipulating
  file names and paths.

* A library of prepackaged tasks to make building rakefiles easier. For example,
  tasks for building tarballs and publishing to FTP or SSH sites.  (Formerly
  tasks for building RDoc and Gems were included in rake but they're now
  available in RDoc and RubyGems respectively.)

* Supports parallel execution of tasks.

    Resque is a Redis-backed Ruby library for creating background jobs,
    placing those jobs on multiple queues, and processing them later.

    Background jobs can be any Ruby class or module that responds to
    perform. Your existing classes can easily be converted to background
    jobs or you can create new classes specifically to do work. Or, you
    can do both.

    Resque is heavily inspired by DelayedJob (which rocks) and is
    comprised of three parts:

    * A Ruby library for creating, querying, and processing jobs
    * A Rake task for starting a worker which processes jobs
    * A Sinatra app for monitoring queues, jobs, and workers.
