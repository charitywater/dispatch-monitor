.TH SOCKSIFY 1 "November 1 2009"
.SH NAME
socksify \- runtime socksification of selected programs
.SH DESCRIPTION
The shell script socksify is meant to aid in using socks with
already compiled dynamic binaries.  This works by setting the
LD_PRELOAD environment variable to libdsocks.  It will then attempt
to wrap all networking-related system calls.

When used the script can socksify a program by simply prefixing
the given program and it's arguments with the the socksify script,
like in the example below.

$ socksify ftp ftp.example.org

.SH ENVIRONMENT
The socksify script, and the Dante socks library used by the socksify
script, can interpret several environment variables.
.TP
\fBSOCKS_CONF\fP
Gives the name of the socks.conf file.  Default is /etc/socks.conf, unless
it was changed when compiling the Dante libsocks libraries.

Creating a socks.conf is the recommended way to use socksify, but socksify
can also be used for most simple configurations without any socks.conf
file, as long as the proxy server to use is set in one of the supported
environment variables.
.TP
\fBSOCKS_DEBUG\fP
Enables debug loging.  The value given should be a number, one or up,
indicating the level of debuging provided.
.TP
\fBSOCKS_LOGOUTPUT\fP
This value controls where the client library sends logoutput.  It can
be either \fBsyslog\fP, \fBstdout\fP, \fBstderr\fP, a filename, or
a combination.  The default is nowhere.
.TP
\fBSOCKS_USERNAME\fP
Use the value of \fBSOCKS_USERNAME\fP as the username when doing
username authentication.
.TP
\fBSOCKS_PASSWORD\fP
Use the value of \fBSOCKS_PASSWORD\fP as the password when doing
username authentication.  Not recommended as other users on the system
might be able to see your password.
.TP
\fBSOCKS_SERVER\fP, \fBSOCKS4_SERVER\fP, \fBSOCKS5_SERVER\fP,
These variables allow the address of the server to be specified
without having a socks.conf file. The accepted format is
<ipaddress>:<port>.
If the \fBSOCKS_SERVER\fP value is set, it indicates the specified server
supports all socks versions supported by Dante.  If if either of the other
two variables are used, they indicate the given socks server supports only
the corresponding socks version, v4 or v5.
Note that if the socks server requires any form of authentication, you
need to use \fBSOCKS5_SERVER\fP, as v4 does not support authentication.
.TP
\fBHTTP_CONNECT_PROXY\fP
This variable can be used to specify the location of a HTTP proxy supporting
the connect request.  The format used to specify a HTTP proxy is
http://<ipaddress>:<port>.
.TP
\fBUPNP_IGD\fP
This variable can be used to specify the location of a UPNP enabled
IGD router.  There are three possible value for this variable: a
full URL, the interface name the router is reachable via, or the value
"broadcast" to search for the IGD on all appropriate interfaces.

.TP
\fINote that if any of the above environment variables, indicating the
\fIproxy server to use are set, the Dante client will not parse the
\fI\fBsocks.conf\fP file.\fP

.TP
\fBSOCKS_AUTOADD_LANROUTES\fP
If this variable is set to "no", the client will not try to auto-add
direct routes for all addresses on the lan.  The default is to add
them.
.TP
\fBSOCKS_DISABLE_THREADLOCK\fP
If this variable is set, the client will not perform threadlocking.
The default is for the client to attempt to figure out for itself
whether the application to socksify needs threadlocking or not.
