.TH SOCKD 8 "November 1 2009"
.SH NAME
sockd \- network proxyserver
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sockd
.RB [ \-DLVdhnv ]
.RB [ \-N
.IR number ]
.RB [ \-f
.IR file ]
.RB [ \-p
.IR file ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Dante
implements the socks standard and can function as a firewall between networks.
.PP
.B Dante
relays TCP and UDP both from outside the network and in, and from inside
and out.
.PP
The options are as follows:
.TP
.B \-D
.B Dante
will detach from the controlling terminal and run in
the background as a system daemon.
.TP
.B \-L
Displays the license
.B Dante
comes under.
.TP
.BI \-N number
.B Dante
will fork of
.I number
"main servers" when starting.  This can be used for servers that are
extremely busy, or to provide a (very) poor mans redundancy setup,
as Dante will try to make these "main servers" as independent of each
others as possible.  It is unlikely that setting this number to anything
higher than the number of CPUs will improve performance.
.TP
.B \-V
Verifies config file and exits.
.TP
.BI \-d number
Sets the level of debugging, zero to disable.
.TP
.BI \-f file
.B Dante
will read its configuration from
.IR file .
.TP
.B \-h
Shows the currently valid options.
.TP
.B \-n
Disables TCP keep-alive messages.  Normally
.B Dante
enables TCP keep-alive messages so that connections from machines that
have crashed or for other reasons no longer can be reached time out.
Note that this can take several hours.  See also the "timeout"
option in sockd.conf(5).
.TP
.BI \-p file
.B Dante
will write the pid of the main process to this file.
.IR file .
.TP
.B \-v
Displays
.B Dante
version.
.SH SIGNALS
.TP
.B SIGHUP
Reload the configuration file.  Will also reopen logfiles.
.TP
.B SIGINFO/SIGUSR1
Print some information about the servers current state and clients.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B TMPDIR
Use
.B TMPDIR
for temporary files.
.B Dante
will use this directory for lockfiles and memory-mapped files.
It is recommended that
.B TMPDIR
be set to a (local) filesystem with low latency.  The directory
should have read/write/execute permission by both the
privileged and unprivileged userid (as specified in
/etc/sockd.conf), but no other non-privileged users.
.SH FILES
.TP
/etc/sockd.conf
.B Dante
server configuration file.
